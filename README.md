## Sublime Text Local Packages

Welcome to my Sublime Text local packages repository. This setup includes custom packages and key bindings tailored for competitive programming and general use. I hope it proves helpful for you.

### Packages Included

#### FastOlympic & Competitive Companion & Hook
These packages facilitate efficient coding during competitive programming contests. You can find more about them and their integration here: [FastOlympicCodingHook](https://github.com/tiger2005/FastOlympicCodingHook).

#### Copy Magic
The `copy_magic` package is written by myself. It enhances the clipboard functionality with custom operations specifically designed for C++ development.

### Key Bindings

Below are my custom key bindings:

```json
[
    { "keys": ["ctrl+shift+c"], "command": "open_terminal" },
    { "keys": ["f11"], "command": "build" },
    { "keys": ["ctrl+c"], "command": "copy_magic" }
]
```

- **Ctrl + Shift + C**: Open Terminal
- **F11**: Build
- **Ctrl + C**: Invoke Copy Magic

These key bindings aim to streamline workflow and improve efficiency.

Feel free to explore and modify these settings to better fit your needs. Happy coding!
